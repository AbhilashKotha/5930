# Project Youth Group Drone Control Mobile App

## Client Profile

A free program in St. Louis teaches teenagers from remote areas how to fly drones professionally. The program covers flying techniques and interpersonal skills. Teenagers who participate in the program feel empowered and excited about their future careers.

## Project Brief

The mobile app  is  cutting edge mobile application specially developed for flying the drone that should be designed in such a way that it is specially designed for operating the drones. It should control the simple features like recording the live video's, collecting the real time data and sprinkling the water when ever a area is effected with the fire. It opens up the world of thrilling drone flying and outstanding photo capture thanks to safety features, controlling the media, and functioning on both iOS and Android devices.

## Functional Requirements

- Arming Procedure: Prior to flying the plane, the user must complete a pre-flight arming procedure to check that all control surfaces and systems are operational.
- Throttle Control: Similar to a gas pedal in an automobile, the user can regulate the engine's power output by moving the left hand up and down. The throttle control has a % range that allows for incremental increases or decreases in power output.
- Rudder Control: A separate control input is provided by the plane's control system for directing the aircraft. The rudder can be adjusted by moving the left hand right or left. The rudder control controls the aircraft's vertical axis direction.
- Elevator/Pitch regulate: The right hand is used to regulate the airplane's pitch (nose up or down). The elevator/pitch control is adjusted by moving the right hand up or down, allowing for gradual changes within a % range.
- Aileron Control: A control input in the plane's control system is used to modify the aircraft's roll. The ailerons can be moved right or left using the user's right hand. This control affects the aircraft's roll or tilt.
- Independent Control: The throttle, rudder, elevator/pitch, and aileron controls operate independently of one another, allowing the user to fine-tune power, direction, angle, and roll.
- Measurement in Percentages: The throttle, rudder, elevator/pitch, and aileron controls are all stated in percentages. This enables the user to make exact modifications within a set range, with a percentage increase or reduction matching to a specific change in the flight parameter.
